## Why Archived?

These documents served their purpose during active development phases but are no longer needed for:
- End users learning the system
- Developers working on new features
- Day-to-day operations

## What Replaced Them?

The essential information from these documents has been consolidated into:
- `/docs/reference/changelog.md` - Feature history and releases
- `/docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` - Development practices
- `/docs/DEVELOPER_STANDARDS_COMPLIANCE.md` - Code standards
- Phase-specific technical details integrated into relevant user/technical guides

## Accessing This Information

If you need historical implementation details:
1. These files remain available in this archive
2. Git history contains all commits and changes
3. Current documentation in `/docs` covers all active features
