## When to Archive

Archive implementation tracker files when:
1. Major restructuring creates temporary versions
2. Analysis documents are no longer needed
3. Sync/update notes are incorporated into main tracker
4. Files are superseded by newer comprehensive versions

**Rule:** Only `IMPLEMENTATION_TRACKER.md` should exist in project root.
