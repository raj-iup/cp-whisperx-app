Translation Notes:
- PRESERVE COMEDIC TIMING - don't over-explain jokes
- Keep Hinglish punchlines as Hinglish when funnier
- Prem's broken English is CHARACTER DEFINING - keep awkward
- Gogo's dialogues: theatrical, over-the-top (amp up in English too)
- Fast-paced banter: prioritize wit over literal accuracy
- Slapstick moments: keep exclamations punchy
- This is COMEDY - let jokes breathe, don't over-subtitle silences
