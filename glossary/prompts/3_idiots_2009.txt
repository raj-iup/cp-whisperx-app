Key Terms:
- "yaar" → "dude/man" (friends constantly)
- "bhai" → "bro"
- "sir" → "sir" (students to Virus, always)
- "machhar" → "mosquito" (Virus calls students this - keep metaphor)
- "chhod de/give up" → "give up/quit" (Raju's fear)
- "all is well" → ALWAYS keep as "all is well" (signature phrase)
- "balatkar" incident → handle sensitively (Chatur's speech mistake)

Engineering/Campus Terms:
- Keep: "ragging", "backbencher", "grade", "GPA", "project"
- "chamcha" → "suck-up/brownnoser"
- "maggu"/"ratta" → "rote-learner" (Chatur)

Catchphrases (SACRED):
- "All is well" (Rancho's mantra - NEVER translate)
- "Aal izz well" (Raju's variant)
- "Kaamyabi nahi, khushi ko chase karo" (Chase excellence, not success)
- "Farhanitrate, Prerajulisation" (Virus's chemical mockery)

Cultural Context:
- Indian engineering college pressure (IIT-like)
- Rote learning vs understanding (education critique)
- Family pressure for conventional careers
- Friendship across economic classes
- Suicide rates in competitive academia
- Chase passion vs money

Translation Notes:
- Rancho's wisdom: keep inspirational tone, quotable
- "All is well" must ALWAYS be in English - it's the film's thesis
- Virus's cruelty: formal Hindi/English mix, authoritarian
- Chatur's speeches: comedic mispronunciations (translate humor carefully)
- Engineering jargon: assume audience knows or contextually explain
- Farhan's voiceover: mature, reflective, nostalgic tone
- Raju's arc: show fear to confidence in language shift
- Delivery scene: tension despite comedy - balance both
- Balcony scene tragedy: handle with gravity
- Keep motivational speeches punchy and memorable
