Film: Queen (2013)
Director: Vikas Bahl
Stars: Kangana Ranaut, Rajkummar Rao, Lisa Haydon
Setting: Delhi, Paris, Amsterdam
Tone: Self-discovery, empowerment, comedy-drama, fish-out-of-water
Language: Delhi Hindi-English mix, broken English abroad, growth in confidence

Characters:
- Rani (female, Kangana): Sheltered Delhi girl, shy to confident transformation
- Vijay (male, Rajkummar): Ex-fiancé, arrogant, London-returned
- Vijayalakshmi (female, Lisa Haydon): Free-spirited, half-Indian, Paris guide
- Taka, Oleksander, Tim: International hostel friends

Key Terms:
- "ji" → "sir/ma'am" (Rani's respectful nature, decreases as she grows)
- "aunty"/"uncle" → keep as-is
- "bhaiya" → "brother" (to shopkeepers, street vendors)
- "sorry" → Rani over-apologizes initially
- "ji" excessive at start → reduced by end (character growth marker)

Rani's Language Evolution:
- Early: Excessive "ji", formal Hindi, apologetic, broken English
- Middle: Mixing more English, assertive, questioning
- End: Confident Hinglish, fewer apologies, self-assured

Cultural Context:
- Conservative Delhi middle-class family
- Solo female travel (radical for character's background)
- Breaking engagement (social taboo)
- Discovering independence and sexuality
- European vs Indian cultural contrasts

Translation Notes:
- Rani's broken English with foreigners: KEEP BROKEN - it's character growth
- Show confidence progression linguistically (less "sorry", less "ji")
- Vijay's English: affected, pseudo-sophisticated (mock gently)
- Vijayalakshmi: effortless global English-Hindi mix
- Paris/Amsterdam locals: accented English (French/Dutch touches)
- Wedding cancellation scene: emotional Hindi (family weight)
- "London" song: celebrate self-worth, empowerment tone
- Rani's voiceover/thoughts: simple, relatable, not over-intellectual
- Hostel bonding: language barriers become bonding moments
- Final confrontation: Rani's newfound voice (assertive, clear)
- Don't over-subtitle Rani's solo travel moments - let visuals speak
- European café/street scenes: minimal dialogue, experiential
- Keep cultural misunderstandings comedic but respectful
