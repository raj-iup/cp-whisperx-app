Period Language Notes:
- Very formal, archaic Hindi (1918-1947 setting)
- Minimal English (only in British officer contexts)
- Marathi-inflected Hindi pronunciation and terms
- Religious/mythological vocabulary (Sanskrit roots)

Translation Notes:
- ATMOSPHERIC over conversational - minimal dialogue overall
- Keep mythological gravitas (this is folklore horror)
- Hastar's name and mythology: do NOT over-explain, keep mystery
- Grandmother's monstrous scenes: visceral, minimal dialogue
- Vinayak's greed: show through actions, sparse words
- Period formality: "aap" (formal you) always, never "tu" (informal)
- British officer dialogue: clipped colonial English
- Rain/environment is character - don't over-subtitle ambient scenes
- Gold coins/curse: visual horror, let images dominate
- Womb imagery: handle mythologically, not literally
- Partition context (1947): show impact subtly
- "Sohum" chant: keep in Sanskrit, translate as subtitle note if needed
- Minimize subtitles in pure horror sequences - let visuals scare
- Greed's consequences: show don't tell through dialogue
- Folklore tradition: narrate like old tale when needed (voiceover style)
