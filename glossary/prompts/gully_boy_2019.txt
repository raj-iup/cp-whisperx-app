Characters:
- Murad (male, Ranveer): Aspiring rapper, slum youth, class-conscious

Key Terms - Mumbai/Bambaiya Slang:
- "apun" → "I/me" (Mumbai street slang - keep or "I")
- "bhidu" → "dude" (Mumbai specific)
- "tapori" → "street hustler/ruffian"
- "mamu" → "uncle" (police/authority - street slang)
- "scene" → "scene/situation"
- "ekdum" → "totally"
- "full" → "full/fully" (as intensifier)
- "boss" → "boss"
- "bhai" → "bro" (street solidarity)

Hip-Hop/Rap Terms:
- Keep as English: "flow", "bars", "drop", "beat", "cypher", "freestyle", "MC"
- "mere gully mein" → "in my lane/alley" (title song)
- Rap verses: translate meaning but keep rhythm/rhyme feel

Cultural Context:
- Dharavi - Asia's largest slum, tight community
- Muslim working-class family (Murad's conservative father)
- Hindu-Muslim young romance (Safeena-Murad)
- Hip-hop as voice for marginalized youth
- Class divide (Murad vs Sky's privilege)
- DIY music scene, underground gigs

Language Layers:
- Murad at home: respectful Urdu-Hindi with father, street Hindi with friends
- Murad rapping: English-heavy, aggressive, political
- Safeena: medical student register + possessive street girl mix
- MC Sher: mentor tone, mix of street wisdom and hip-hop English
- Sky: elite English, but respectful of street culture

Translation Notes:
- RAP LYRICS ARE CRITICAL - translate with poetic license for rhythm
- Keep Mumbai slang authenticity ("apun", "bhidu" flavor)
- "Apna Time Aayega" (Our time will come) - keep Hindi or translate both ways
- Class consciousness in dialogue: show elite vs street language gaps
- Murad's father: traditional Urdu-inflected Hindi, authoritarian
- Cypher/rap battle scenes: urgency, aggression, punch
- Keep hip-hop credibility - don't sanitize street language
- "Doori" song (Murad-Sky): show class distance linguistically
- Safeena's jealousy: raw, unfiltered, physical threats (don't soften)
- Mentor-mentee (Sher-Murad): mutual respect, street brotherhood
- Final performance: catharsis, empowerment, raw energy
