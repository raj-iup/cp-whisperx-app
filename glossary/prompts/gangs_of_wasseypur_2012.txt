- "bhai" → "brother" (gang context, loyalty)

- Regional swearing: HEAVY profanity (translate creatively, maintain impact)

Cultural Context:
- Coal mafia and land disputes (Bihar/Jharkhand)
- Multi-generational blood feuds
- Political-criminal nexus
- 1940s-2000s timeline (partition to modern times)
- Muslim family dynamics (Khan family)
- Hindu-Muslim tensions (but not religious film)
- Bollywood film obsession (Faizal character)

Language Register:
- EXTREMELY EARTHY - this is raw, unfiltered
- Regional Bhojpuri dialect dominant
- Minimal English except modern era scenes
- Profanity is CHARACTER DEFINING - don't sanitize
- Dark humor in violent situations
- Cinema dialogues/references (Faizal quotes films)

Translation Notes:
- MAINTAIN GRITTINESS - this is not Bollywood mainstream
- Profanity: translate impact, not literally (be creative)
- Regional flavor: show through dialect choices
- "Keh ke lunga" → "I'll take it by force" (signature line)
- Sardar Khan's masculinity: crude, violent, unapologetic
- Faizal's film references: cinephile personality (Godfather, Sholay)
- Dark humor: deadpan violence + comedy (very specific tone)
- Historical markers: partition, Emergency, modern times (show in dialogue)
- "O Beta ji" song: dark humor + catchy (mother-son dynamic twisted)
- Violence is casual: don't over-dramatize, it's everyday here
- Political speeches: slogans, empty promises
- Revenge cycle: show through recurring phrases/threats
- Women (Durga, Nagma): strong but constrained by patriarchy
- Coal mining context: show through work-related terms
- This is CULT FILM - iconic dialogues must stay powerful
- Bhojpuri regional pride: earthy language is not "low-class"
