## ⏱️ Updated Timeouts (All Stages)

| Stage | Service | Timeout | Duration |
|-------|---------|---------|----------|
| 1. DEMUX | demux | 600s | 10 min |
| 2. TMDB | tmdb | 60s | 1 min |

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

### For Full-Length Movies (2-3 hours)

**Silero VAD Processing Time:**
- Short clips (5-10 min): 30-60 seconds
- TV episode (45 min): 3-5 minutes
- Movie (90 min): 8-12 minutes
- Long movie (150 min): 15-20 minutes
- **Our movie (150 min):** Expected 15-20 minutes ✅

With 30-minute timeout, we have comfortable margin.

---

## ✅ Why This Matters

### Problem
- Previous 15-minute timeout too aggressive for full movies
- Pipeline stopped mid-processing
- Had to restart (but resume worked!)

### Solution
- Doubled timeout to 30 minutes
- Covers 99% of use cases
- Still has reasonable upper bound

### Benefits
- ✅ Handles full-length movies
- ✅ Maintains timeout protection
- ✅ Prevents indefinite hangs
- ✅ Resume feature ready if needed

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Monitor Current Run** (12:35 - 13:05)
2. **Verify Stage Completion**
3. **Continue Through Remaining Stages:**
   - PyAnnote VAD (optional, may skip)
   - Diarization (30 min)
   - ASR (60 min)
   - Post-NER (10 min)
   - Subtitle Gen (5 min)
   - Mux (10 min)

**Expected Total Time:** 2-3 hours from now
