# Business Requirement Document

**Document ID:** BRD-012  
**Title:** Centralized Log Management  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2025-12-08  
**Status:** ✅ Approved | ⏳ Not Yet Implemented  
**Author:** System Architect

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Establish centralized log management by enforcing all log files (test logs, debug logs, manual script logs) to be placed in the `logs/` directory. This keeps the project root clean, improves log discoverability, and provides consistent log organization across all project activities.

---

## 2. Business Objectives

### 2.1 Problem Statement
- Test and debug logs are created in project root, cluttering the directory
- No consistent location for log files across different activities
- Difficult to find relevant logs when debugging
- `.gitignore` requires constant updates for new log patterns
- Project root cleanliness affects professionalism and maintainability

### 2.2 Goals
- **Primary:** Keep project root clean (zero log files)
- **Secondary:** Consistent log organization across all activities
- **Tertiary:** Easy log discovery and management

### 2.3 Success Criteria
- ✅ All log files in `logs/` directory
- ✅ Zero log files in project root
- ✅ Helper functions for log path generation
- ✅ Documentation of log organization patterns
- ✅ `.gitignore` simplified (single `logs/` entry)

## 3. Stakeholders

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| Developers | Use log helpers, place logs correctly |
| QA Team | Find test logs easily |
| Project Maintainers | Benefit from clean project root |
| CI/CD | Consistent log artifact location |

---

## 4. User Requirements

### 4.1 User Stories

**US-001:** As a **developer**, I want **log files automatically placed in logs/ directory** so that **I don't clutter the project root**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Helper function `get_log_path()` available
- [ ] Function creates appropriate subdirectories
- [ ] Function generates timestamped log names
- [ ] Documentation shows usage patterns

**US-002:** As a **QA engineer**, I want **test logs organized by category** so that **I can find relevant logs quickly**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] `logs/testing/unit/` for unit test logs
- [ ] `logs/testing/integration/` for integration test logs
- [ ] `logs/testing/functional/` for functional test logs
- [ ] `logs/testing/manual/` for manual test logs
- [ ] Timestamped log names with descriptive suffixes

**US-003:** As a **developer debugging issues**, I want **debug logs in dedicated location** so that **I can separate them from test logs**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] `logs/debug/` for debug logs
- [ ] `logs/profiling/` for performance logs
- [ ] Easy to clear old debug logs

**US-004:** As a **project maintainer**, I want **clean project root** so that **the project looks professional and organized**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Zero log files in project root
- [ ] `.gitignore` has single entry: `logs/`
- [ ] Pre-commit hook prevents log file commits

## 5. Functional Requirements

### FR-001: Log Path Helper Function
**Priority:** Critical  
**Description:** Provide `get_log_path(category, test_name, descriptor)` function  
**Rationale:** Enable consistent log placement

**Status:** ⏳ Not Started

### FR-002: Log Directory Structure
**Priority:** High  
**Description:** Define standard log directory categories  
**Rationale:** Organize logs by purpose

**Categories:**
- `logs/testing/unit/`
- `logs/testing/integration/`
- `logs/testing/functional/`
- `logs/testing/manual/`
- `logs/debug/`
- `logs/profiling/`

**Status:** ⏳ Not Started

### FR-003: Documentation & Examples
**Priority:** High  
**Description:** Document log organization in DEVELOPER_STANDARDS.md and Copilot Instructions  
**Rationale:** Ensure consistent adoption

**Status:** ✅ Complete (documented in Copilot Instructions § AD-012)

### FR-004: Migration of Existing Logs
**Priority:** Medium  
**Description:** Move existing log files to appropriate directories  
**Rationale:** Clean up project root

**Status:** ⏳ Not Started

### FR-005: CI/CD Integration
**Priority:** Low  
**Description:** Configure CI/CD to archive logs/ directory as artifacts  
**Rationale:** Enable log retrieval from CI runs

**Status:** ⏳ Not Started

---

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

### 6.1 Usability
- **Helper Function:** Easy to use, self-documenting
- **Path Generation:** Automatic timestamp, descriptive names
- **Directory Creation:** Automatic (no manual mkdir needed)

### 6.2 Maintainability
- **Centralized:** Single location for all logs
- **Organized:** Clear categories for different log types
- **Discoverable:** Easy to find relevant logs

### 6.3 Storage
- **Log Retention:** Manual cleanup (no automatic deletion)
- **Size Management:** User responsibility
- **Cleanup Tools:** Provide utility scripts if needed

---

## 7. Constraints & Assumptions

### 7.1 Constraints
- **Backward Compatibility:** Existing logs may be in wrong locations
- **Migration Effort:** Need to update existing scripts
- **CI/CD Impact:** May need to update artifact collection

### 7.2 Assumptions
- Developers will use helper function once available
- Log file cleanup is user's responsibility
- Disk space not a major constraint
- Log files don't need to be version-controlled

---

## 8. Dependencies

- **shared/log_paths.py:** New module for helper functions
- **AD-012:** Architecture decision
- **.gitignore:** Update to ignore `logs/` directory
- **Documentation:** DEVELOPER_STANDARDS.md, Copilot Instructions

---

## 9. Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|-------------|---------------------|
| Developers forget to use helper function | Medium | Medium | Documentation, code review, examples |
| Existing scripts continue using old patterns | Low | High | Gradual migration, update on modification |
| Log directory grows large over time | Low | High | Document cleanup process, consider rotation |
| CI/CD breaks if logs not in expected location | Medium | Low | Update CI/CD configuration proactively |

---

## 10. Timeline & Milestones

| Phase | Duration | Deliverable | Status |
|-------|----------|-------------|--------|
| Phase 1 | Complete | Architecture decision (AD-012) | ✅ Done |
| Phase 2 | Complete | Documentation | ✅ Done |
| Phase 3 | 1 hour | Helper function implementation | ⏳ Planned |
| Phase 4 | 30 min | Migrate existing logs | ⏳ Planned |
| Phase 5 | 30 min | Update .gitignore | ⏳ Planned |

**Estimate:** 1-2 hours total  
**Priority:** Medium (quality of life improvement)
