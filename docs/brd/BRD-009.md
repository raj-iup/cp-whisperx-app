# Business Requirement Document

**Document ID:** BRD-009  
**Title:** Quality-First Development Philosophy  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2025-12-05  
**Status:** ✅ Approved & Implemented  
**Author:** System Architect

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Establish a development philosophy that prioritizes output quality (transcription accuracy, translation quality, subtitle quality) over backward compatibility during the active development phase (pre-v3.0). This enables aggressive optimization and direct implementation of optimal solutions without compatibility constraints.

---

## 2. Business Objectives

### 2.1 Problem Statement
- Current development pace is slowed by maintaining backward compatibility with suboptimal code
- Developers hesitate to replace low-quality implementations due to compatibility concerns
- Testing focuses on "does it work" rather than "is it the best quality"
- Active development phase (pre-v3.0) provides unique opportunity for aggressive improvement

### 2.2 Goals
- **Primary:** Maximize output quality (ASR WER, Translation BLEU, Subtitle Quality scores)
- **Secondary:** Establish clear development philosophy for all contributors
- **Tertiary:** Enable faster iteration during development phase

### 2.3 Success Criteria
- ✅ All developers understand quality-first philosophy
- ✅ Code reviews focus on quality metrics, not backward compatibility
- ✅ Test suites validate quality baselines, not just functionality
- ✅ Documentation clearly states "no backward compatibility guarantee" for v3.0

---

## 3. Stakeholders

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| Development Team | Implement optimal solutions, ignore compatibility |
| QA/Testing | Validate quality metrics, establish baselines |
| Users (Internal) | Accept breaking changes, re-run pipelines |
| Documentation | Clearly communicate philosophy |

---

## 4. User Requirements

### 4.1 User Stories

**US-001:** As a **developer**, I want **clear guidance on prioritizing quality over compatibility** so that **I can confidently replace suboptimal code with optimal implementations**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Development philosophy documented
- [x] Quality metrics defined (ASR WER, Translation BLEU, Subtitle Quality)
- [x] Compatibility policy explicitly stated
- [x] Examples of "good" vs "bad" development patterns

**US-002:** As a **QA engineer**, I want **quality-focused test baselines** so that **I can validate that changes improve output quality**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Test media samples defined
- [x] Quality baselines established (ASR ≤5% WER, Translation ≥90% BLEU, Subtitle ≥88%)
- [x] Test suite validates quality, not just functionality

**US-003:** As a **user**, I want **to understand that v3.0 development prioritizes quality** so that **I expect breaking changes and am prepared to re-run pipelines**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Clear communication in README
- [x] Version policy documented
- [x] Migration guidance provided when v3.0 releases

## 5. Functional Requirements

### FR-001: Development Philosophy Documentation
**Priority:** Critical  
**Description:** Document the quality-first philosophy in all key project documents  
**Rationale:** Ensure all contributors understand and follow the philosophy

### FR-002: Quality Metrics Definition
**Priority:** Critical  
**Description:** Define measurable quality targets for all outputs  
**Rationale:** Enable objective validation of improvements

### FR-003: Test Suite Quality Focus
**Priority:** High  
**Description:** Update test suites to validate quality metrics  
**Rationale:** Prevent quality regressions

### FR-004: Code Review Guidelines
**Priority:** High  
**Description:** Establish code review criteria focusing on quality  
**Rationale:** Ensure consistent application of philosophy

---

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

### 6.1 Performance
- No backward compatibility overhead during v3.0 development
- Direct implementation of optimal solutions

### 6.2 Quality
- **ASR Accuracy:** ≥95% (WER ≤5%) for clean audio
- **Translation Quality:** ≥90% BLEU score for Indic languages
- **Subtitle Quality:** ≥88% overall quality score
- **Processing Speed:** Optimize where it doesn't sacrifice quality

### 6.3 Maintainability
- Clear documentation of quality-first approach
- Consistent application across all features
- Easy to understand for new contributors

---

## 7. Constraints & Assumptions

### 7.1 Constraints
- **Time Constraint:** Active development phase (pre-v3.0)
- **Resource Constraint:** Single development team
- **Technical Constraint:** Must maintain external API compatibility (but NOT internal)

### 7.2 Assumptions
- Users understand v3.0 is in active development
- Users accept breaking changes for quality improvements
- v3.0 release will establish stable API contract

---

## 8. Dependencies

- None (foundational philosophy)

---

## 9. Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|-------------|---------------------|
| Developer confusion about when to maintain compatibility | Medium | Low | Clear documentation, code review enforcement |
| Quality regressions during aggressive refactoring | High | Medium | Establish quality baselines, comprehensive testing |
| User frustration with breaking changes | Low | Medium | Clear communication, migration guides at v3.0 |

---

## 10. Timeline & Milestones

| Phase | Duration | Deliverable | Status |
|-------|----------|-------------|--------|
| Phase 1 | Complete | Philosophy documentation | ✅ Done |
| Phase 2 | Complete | Quality metrics definition | ✅ Done |
| Phase 3 | Complete | Update Copilot Instructions | ✅ Done |
