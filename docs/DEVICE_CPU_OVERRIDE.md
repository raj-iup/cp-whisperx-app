# Device Override: Force CPU Until MPS Support Ready ✅

## Change Summary

Updated preflight to force CPU usage even when MPS (Apple Silicon GPU) is available, since the pipeline code is not yet ready to run on MPS.

---

## 🔄 What Changed

### 1. Device Priority Updated ✅

**Before:**
```
Priority: CUDA > MPS > CPU
```

**After:**
```
Priority: CUDA > CPU (MPS detected but not used)
```

### 2. Clear User Messaging ✅

**Output Now Shows:**
```
============================================================
Compute Devices
============================================================
ℹ INFO CUDA not available (no NVIDIA GPUs)
✓ PASS MPS (Apple Silicon) available
       Metal Performance Shaders enabled
✓ PASS CPU available
       arm (arm64)

Pipeline device: CPU
       Using CPU
       Note: MPS detected but not yet supported - using CPU
```

**Key Points:**
- Still detects MPS (shows it's available)
- Clearly states using CPU
- Explains why: "not yet supported"

### 3. JSON Output Enhanced ✅

**New Fields:**
```json
{
  "devices": {
    "cuda": {"available": false, "device_count": 0, "devices": []},
    "mps": {"available": true},
    "cpu": {"available": true}
  },
  "pipeline_device": "cpu",
  "device_note": "MPS available but not yet supported - using CPU"
}
```

**Changed:**
- `recommended_device` → `pipeline_device` (clearer naming)
- Added `device_note` field when MPS is available but not used

## 🎯 Device Logic

### determine_best_device() Function

```python
def determine_best_device(self, devices: Dict) -> str:
    """
    Determine the best compute device to use.
    
    Priority: CUDA > CPU (MPS not yet supported)
    
    Returns:
        Device string: "cuda" or "cpu"
    """
    if devices["cuda"]["available"]:
        return "cuda"
    else:
        # Force CPU for now - MPS support not ready yet
        return "cpu"
```

**Logic:**
1. If CUDA available → use CUDA
2. Otherwise → use CPU (even if MPS available)
3. MPS is detected and reported but not used

## 🔧 Pipeline Integration

### Reading Device Configuration

```python
import json
from pathlib import Path

# Read preflight results
preflight_file = Path("out/preflight_results.json")
with open(preflight_file) as f:
    preflight = json.load(f)

# Get device to use
device = preflight.get("pipeline_device", "cpu")
print(f"Using device: {device}")  # Output: Using device: cpu

# Check if there's a note
if "device_note" in preflight:
    print(f"Note: {preflight['device_note']}")
    # Output: Note: MPS available but not yet supported - using CPU
```

### Creating Job Configuration

```python
def create_job_env(input_file: str, preflight_results: dict):
    """
    Create job-specific .env file based on preflight device detection.
    """
    # Get device to use (will be "cuda" or "cpu", never "mps" for now)
    device = preflight_results.get("pipeline_device", "cpu")
    devices = preflight_results.get("devices", {})
    
    # Configure based on device
    if device == "cuda":
        # CUDA configuration
        gpu_count = devices["cuda"]["device_count"]
        gpu_memory = devices["cuda"]["devices"][0]["total_memory_gb"]
        
        job_config = {
            "DEVICE": "cuda",
            "COMPUTE_TYPE": "float16",
            "BATCH_SIZE": min(16, int(gpu_memory / 2)),
            "NUM_WORKERS": gpu_count * 2,
        }
    else:
        # CPU configuration (including when MPS is available but not used)
        job_config = {
            "DEVICE": "cpu",
            "COMPUTE_TYPE": "int8",  # Quantized for CPU
            "BATCH_SIZE": 4,
            "NUM_WORKERS": 2,
        }
    
    return job_config
```

## 🔮 Future: Enabling MPS Support

When ready to enable MPS support, update `determine_best_device()`:

```python
def determine_best_device(self, devices: Dict) -> str:
    """
    Determine the best compute device to use.
    
    Priority: CUDA > MPS > CPU
    
    Returns:
        Device string: "cuda", "mps", or "cpu"
    """
    if devices["cuda"]["available"]:
        return "cuda"
    elif devices["mps"]["available"]:
        return "mps"  # Enable MPS when ready
    else:
        return "cpu"
```

And update the display message:

```python
if best_device == "cuda":
    print(f"       Using CUDA GPU acceleration for optimal performance")
elif best_device == "mps":
    print(f"       Using Apple Silicon GPU acceleration")
else:
    print(f"       Using CPU")
```

**Also remove the device_note logic** in `save_results()`.

## 🎯 Benefits of This Approach

### 1. Transparency ✅
- Users see MPS is available
- Clear explanation why it's not used
- No confusion about capability vs. usage

### 2. Future-Ready ✅
- MPS detection already working
- Easy to enable when code is ready
- Just update one function

### 3. Accurate Reporting ✅
- JSON shows actual device to be used
- Note explains the override
- Pipeline knows exactly what to configure

### 4. Safe Default ✅
- CPU always works
- No surprises or crashes
- Stable until MPS support is ready

---

## ✅ Validation

### Test 1: Preflight Shows Correct Info
```bash
$ python preflight.py --force
# ✅ Shows MPS available
# ✅ Shows pipeline will use CPU
# ✅ Shows note about MPS not yet supported
```

### Test 2: JSON Contains Correct Fields
```bash
$ cat out/preflight_results.json | jq '.pipeline_device'
"cpu"

$ cat out/preflight_results.json | jq '.device_note'
"MPS available but not yet supported - using CPU"
```

### Test 3: Pipeline Can Read Configuration
```python
import json
preflight = json.load(open("out/preflight_results.json"))
assert preflight["pipeline_device"] == "cpu"
assert "device_note" in preflight
# ✅ Tests pass
```

## 📝 Summary

**Current Behavior:**
- ✅ Detects CUDA, MPS, and CPU
- ✅ Forces CPU usage (even with MPS)
- ✅ Clearly explains the override
- ✅ Saves accurate device info to JSON
- ✅ Pipeline will use CPU configuration

**When MPS Support Ready:**
- Update `determine_best_device()` to include MPS
- Update display messages
- Remove device_note logic
- Test on Apple Silicon
- Pipeline will automatically use MPS

**Status:** 🚀 **PRODUCTION READY** with CPU-only support

**Next Step:** Pipeline orchestrator can now read `pipeline_device` from preflight results and configure accordingly!
